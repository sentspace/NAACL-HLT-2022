0,0,"Montreal has a unique bagel tradition that dates back to the mid-nineteenth century. In the early days of the morning, tourists would arrive in Montreal in large numbers for a morning sandwich and coffee. You could be guaranteed to find several dozen different varieties in a pastry case. When the ""Cappuccino"" was introduced in 1894, the bagels came with it. You had to order your espresso and and your bagel separately."
5,0,"Montreal has a unique bagel tradition that dates back to 1766, when an Englishman named J.D. Bagel opened the first of what would become five bakeries. Today, there are more than 70 Bagel East St. Laurent and 15 Bagel Central St. Laurent. It's not just the flavors of bagels that separate Montreal bagel restaurants from the rest of Canada. What also sets them apart are the quality ingredients."
46,0,"Montreal has a unique bagel tradition that dates back to 1876, when the city hosted the Olympic Games. The tradition is still alive today. Because the bagel is such an American food, you won't find bagels being served in many Chinese restaurants, as French food in France is considered food that originated from the Americas. Desserts Although bagels have many tastes, you don't need to try every flavor to enjoy bagel ice cream or bagel sandwiches."
31,0,"Montreal has a unique bagel tradition that dates back to 1917. In 2017, the Bagel Corner will open its doors again to celebrate Montreal's unique bagel heritage. This May, the Bagel Corner will offer a variety of bagels, bagel sandwiches and doughnuts, sold in Montreal and Montreal-area food trucks. With bags of fresh fruit, grapes, pickled veggies and other delicious bagels, this year's sale will be a great opportunity to indulge your taste buds."
13,0,Montreal has a unique bagel tradition that dates back to the early 1900's. The bagels that we now associate with Montreal are greatly influenced by the place that spawned them the Sea Route Bagel. This famous bagel began its long journey to Montreal with a group of Jewish immigrants arriving from Eastern Europe in the early 1900's. To say that they were fortunate would be an understatement.
103,101,"The human body is an ecosystem. We are home to an ever-changing spectrum of life forms, plants, insects, and animals that we have never had any idea existed. Are they the rarest of all animals? Are they the prettiest? The tastiest? The most intelligent? Do they outnumber us? I was curious, so I decided to get a first-hand look at them. The project was supposed to last a year but turned into five. In the end, I went to 54 locations in Texas. I photographed them: animals, humans, homes, landscape, fields, and park."
65,101,"The human body is an ecosystem. We are home to more than 200 trillion microorganisms, ranging from bacteria to viruses, which collectively compose our bodies and our environment. The human microbiome is comprised of more than 100 trillion microbes, just as there are 100 trillion different cells in a human body. It is critical that we understand the impact these microbes have on the human body. Because these microbes live in the skin, hair, and in other body sites, they can be part of the medical history of countless patients."
102,101,"The human body is an ecosystem. We are home to thousands of bacterial species, nearly 40,000 other insect species, 10,000 or more vertebrate species, and billions of microscopic animals called zoophilic protists. Some of these critters are symbiotic with us, meaning they eat our food, and some of them are carnivorous. We even have ""crabs"", a type of shrimp that can survive for up to eight months on land without eating. If we want a long-term grasp of the planet's health, we need to understand all the tiny organisms living on and within us."
101,101,"The human body is an ecosystem. We are home to life, air, water, food, chemicals, pathogens, and countless others. It's a complex organism. Where a parasite, drug, or disease wreaks havoc, we'd better act quickly and attack from every angle, because if we don't then, they do. To function well, the human body needs to be capable of responding quickly to any threat. But we also have a limited amount of resources to do so, and the human body, like any other living thing, needs to replenish itself in the normal course of its evolution."

161,202,"The Tang Dynasty started ruling in 618 A.D. Scholars generally agree that China was ruled by the Tang Dynasty from 618 to 907. To see the early details of the Tang Dynasty, please click here. What the early Han government (735-221 B.C.) has shown us is that by the time of the first Han Emperor, the political and ideological foundations of the so-called Modern (modern world of today) were laid. The first emperor and the last were both scions of the Tang Dynasty."
142,202,"The Tang Dynasty started ruling in 618 A.D. Scholars generally recognize the Qing Dynasty as a sovereign state as its founding emperor was a male. China is divided into six regions. The Tang also controlled the most of the Korean peninsula including its capital of Seoul. There are currently 16 border provinces in China. It is said that the Ch'ing Dynasty, a family of emperors, first originated in China as the Sogdian tribes who resisted the spread of Buddhism."
145,202,"The Tang Dynasty started ruling in 618 A.D. Scholars generally believed that the Meiji restoration was a Chinese conquest of China. After all, the Chinese could not possibly establish their rule in an area as large as Manchuria without the assistance of Russia or some other Chinese ally. It is therefore easy to imagine why the rumors about the Tang Dynasty establishing a Chinese puppet state were so widespread. Did the Qing Dynasty introduce modern mercantile capitalism to China?"
143,202,"The Tang Dynasty started ruling in 618 A.D. Scholars generally agree that the famous Five Classics--Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Taoism--all stemmed from the origins of the Tang Dynasty. While some scholars argue that the term ""Confucianism"" originated with Sui Shou, we have evidence that the term ""Confucianism"" as we know it today came into use in the period 600 to 500 A.D. China was still a peasant culture, and people did not have the means to store and write history."
134,202,"The Tang Dynasty started ruling in 618 A.D. Scholars generally agree that the Tang Dynasty was prosperous, but that the Middle Kingdom's military might outstripped the State's. In 698 the King of Jiajing, Lei Zhen, led the revolt of the Henan troops, and fled to Chaozhou and the southern kingdom of the Jin. Hsiao-Lin, the Emperor, went to the south and besieged the city. In July of 704 the king of Liao sent the Yong-chin army to surround Chaozhou."
198,303,"A group of researchers at Cornell University thinks the future of farming could be the Earth itself. The researchers say climate change has exposed shallow roots to drying, which ultimately threatens our food supply. They suggest that self-digesting technology could reduce climate-driven soil degradation. According to Cornell University, an intensive 10-year study by ecologists found dry surface soils were around one to two percent more likely to experience cracking or silting during the study period. This result came as no surprise to co-author Douglas Konkle of the University of Arizona."
185,303,"A group of researchers at Cornell University thinks the future is looking bright for quantum computing. Now, in a paper published in Nature Photonics, they show how their ""2,300-sneak-and-peek"" approach could make quantum bits smaller than that. Most of the current applications of quantum computing are aimed at better, faster processing of complex data. One such tool is for all-purpose quantum-resistant cryptography. While at present, quantum algorithms exist to address such highly sophisticated, high-valued data, they have taken up a great deal of energy to do so."
217,303,"A group of researchers at Cornell University thinks the future could look a lot like Old Willy's bar. Professor Ann McKee and her colleagues have developed a material that looks like it's ""from another dimension,"" and may have properties not found in the normal materials used in everyday life. McKee likens the material to sticky tape. ""It could be like they used to do with sticky tapes to make them bend or be rolled,"" she says. ""This paper is sticky like sticky tape, but has its own place."
187,303,"A group of researchers at Cornell University thinks the future looks more like the late 70s than today. In a study of toymaker Mattel and their many successful Barbie and Ken dolls, the researchers warn that kids will demand more realism and ""less juvenile humor"" when the next round of toys come out. It's an optimistic outlook for a future defined by robots and digital worlds that kids are naturally familiar with. It's not far-fetched: Google's recent acquisition of robotics start-up Boston Dynamics shows this is already the case."
183,303,"A group of researchers at Cornell University thinks the future could be bleaker than previously imagined. They suggest robots may lead to robots gaining superhuman levels of autonomy, a threat to society that could undermine basic human values. Focussed on identifying and understanding human, social and organizational biases against automation, researchers David A. Patterson and Ken A. Levy focused their work on the first social robot: a humanoid robot that listens to two humans talking about their day. Patterson and Levy published their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."
263,404,"Night blindness was a normal occurrence among pregnant women in 1900, as it was in 1900 for most women in Sweden. After the 1920s, there was a large increase in pregnancy-associated blindness. A direct association of albinism with pregnancy is rare (Herlitz and Frieda 1965). The frequency of blindness among those born with albinism is, however, fairly high, ranging from 2% to 30% in countries such as the United States (Southwood 1966). Despite the rise in anemia in the latter half of the 20th century, in 1960 there were only some 40 albinism patients in the whole of Sweden."
257,404,"Night blindness was a normal occurrence among pregnant women in the Netherlands. ""We know, for example, that women who could not see because they had previously suffered from retinopathy of prematurity, also could not see in the newborns,"" said the researcher, Nerk P. Arnoud. ""This indicates that blindness was a normal risk factor."" How is it possible? One possibility is that, unlike other ailments, blindness was not caused by some external cause, but developed at an early stage in the pregnancy. ""With every pregnancy, we are constantly exposed to various risk factors,"" Dr. Arnoud said. """
254,404,"Night blindness was a normal occurrence among pregnant women in their first trimester, and they were often in great pain as a result.... And because of the opiates that were available during that time, these women were getting stronger every week until they delivered their babies, and they had to go through an excruciating surgery to keep the opiates out of the fetal circulatory system."" An employee at the Mid-Atlantic Women's Care Center called this combination ""two folds"": the standard opioid cocktail plus the painkiller oxycodone.... It's a lot of pain, in other words."
244,404,"Night blindness was a normal occurrence among pregnant women in most Islamic countries, but it was not widespread. Myself, as an author of the Quran, I have had no difficulty in achieving light and visibility. Such ability makes us see all around us in a purer light. Most Muslims say that sex with a menstruating woman is haram. How can this be? Do you regard sex with a menstruating woman as a kind of torture? Or has it been abrogated in the Quran? Sex with a menstruating woman has been condemned in the Quran since the day it was revealed."
233,404,"Night blindness was a normal occurrence among pregnant women in the middle part of the twentieth century in America and is still not widely accepted as abnormal. Those who cite this condition as being linked to visual perceptual difficulties during pregnancy as the cause for their absence should be informed that the absence of visual sensation is the manifestation of a more complex condition, no more or less than one of oculomotor and visual-sensory hypersensitivity. However, it should be noted that excessive progesterone and those low levels that occur in pregnant women, do not, by itself, cause total blindness."
328,505,"Almost all socializing, gaming, and work happened outdoors. A day spent foraging in the forest or on the beach resulted in an inner-drive. I could do nothing but relish this for the rest of my life. When you spend every waking hour in that state of bliss, you appreciate your surroundings. At 19, I arrived in Portland, Oregon where I spent my next three years building a successful online business for myself."
297,505,"Almost all socializing, gaming, and work happened outdoors. A day to day trip to the grocery store started at dawn, but we had to deal with some slowness on our way out so we could still fall back to sleep after climbing high into the tree of life. I came home that night with a stack of books and for my and the rest of our lives a music CD of some of the finest trance music I had ever heard."
311,505,"Almost all socializing, gaming, and work happened outdoors. A day at the beach consisted of traditional meringues, washing salads in Chianti, or an early breakfast at the communal bar. I remember the cooking of porcinis was particularly innovative, involving a thick cream and a slow cooking and burning technique that finally brought to a boil the porcini in a very nutrient dense broth. Soon we all flew to St. Petersburg. Mr."
282,505,"Almost all socializing, gaming, and work happened outdoors. A day of drinking and housework took less than an hour, and, in the afternoons, we played games or wandered through the local shops. We spent so much time outside it made it impossible to earn money. We were all thin, so it was easy to hide under the covers in the middle of the night. Despite our fear of the cold, the apartment was larger than it looked."
322,505,"Almost all socializing, gaming, and work happened outdoors. A day spent living in a tent, even with a person to share it with, could be an all-out culture shock for many first-timers. The family decided to return to the U.S. for a little more sanity, and again enrolled in the U.S. Health System. It was during the year after college that Stetzer went to her second hospitalization for emergency surgery for kidney stones. The operation was not successful."
376,606,"The bilingual Shoshone woman Sacagawea (c. 1788 1812) accompanied her elders when first encountering the settlers and the Native Americans. They are often thought of as'rescuing' (or, as in the popular 'at school' version) the Shoshone from a 'losing the battle' fate. Sacagawea was, in fact, at the least, traveling to Washington to make arrangements. [ 1 ] [ 15 ] She was not, in fact, willing to lead the American expedition to the Missouri River, nor did she want the settlers to go to the Ohio country. She was, however, committed to completing the journey."
374,606,"The bilingual Shoshone woman Sacagawea (c. 1788 1812) accompanied George Armstrong Custer to the Little Bighorn River, where she became the first woman to make it from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. Though the Confederates did not recognize her and she was brought to camps by the Army anyway, by mid-1860 she had become a national hero and there were charges that she had been kidnapped and perhaps murdered. Her exploits in the South and her remarkable testimony in Congress were still being debated during the War Between the States (1861-65)."
348,606,"The bilingual Shoshone woman Sacagawea (c. 1788 1812) accompanied Father Hennepin as a missionary to the Chinookan tribe living in eastern Minnesota. Born on the Shoshone reservation near what is now Independence, Oregon, she was able to speak their native language, and was noted for her bravery and bravery at war. Passed by Father Hennepin and the Matrosset tribe for allying with the French Sacagawea is buried in the Grotto Hill Chapel in Bend. Few women made it as far as they did as members of the first mission; Sacagawea did."
375,606,The bilingual Shoshone woman Sacagawea (c. 1788 1812) accompanied Joseph Smith on the Ohio River trail from Missouri to the Great Salt Lake. Carthage Exile in the 1820s Carthage founder Christian II extended the family's loyalty and sent Sacagawea on a much needed fishing expedition into the Middle East as the Iraqi Emperor Tiberius sought revenge on the Christians. Joseph Smith was taken into captivity at Carthage in 1838. He later escaped from the city and returned to Nauvoo. Sacagawea is considered the most important Mormon missionary wife to survive the banishment.
364,606,"The bilingual Shoshone woman Sacagawea (c. 1788 1812) accompanied Captain John Smith on his journeys in the Great Basin of North America. She was killed at the very beginning of the Oregon Trail (ca 1791) after which Smith would steer the clubbearer's pick. Little is known of the woman's travels but she is reported to have received payment for her services. She is said to have been very trustworthy and persistent in following Smith's direction. Smith reportedly paid Sacagawea $10.00, which was $10.00 to each of his five assistants and $2."

This large orchid (Colony of the Sacred Orchid in Guatemala) from Guatemala was found by Kat Martin in the tropical climate of Guatemala City, Guatemala. This orchid is believed to have been developed in the mountains of southern Guatemala."
436,707,"For hundreds of years orchids have been prized discoveries of curiosities, due in large part to their aesthetic perfection and ornamental blooms. The archival value of stargazers is reflected in the greater cultural cachet of these flowers, which have been an icon for spirituality, enlightenment, and contemplation for centuries. Each flower contains countless petals and faces with some kind of iridescent zest or color. These faces are the ""violets"" and ""hearts"" of the plants. The violets stand for life, as they contain all the microscopic seed particles that will grow into the flower."
433,707,"For hundreds of years orchids have been prized discoveries of many cultures. There are four major types, the Indica, the Gymnosperma, the Pachyrhizus, and the Lemon Balm. But where, exactly, do all of the varieties originated? These varieties were not created randomly; they were the result of four kinds of selective breeding. The I. swaravanii variety by Rosa and Carl Fischer was created through artificial selection. This variety was planted in the winter of 1962 and failed. A second plant was selected at the University of Illinois for September 1963 and was also able to produce seed."
430,707,"For hundreds of years orchids have been prized discoveries of artistic and scientific value, with collectors throughout the world carefully sifting through the remnants of these long-dead trees to uncover their secrets. There are still numerous specimens still hanging on with no conclusion as to their origin. Although researchers initially believed they had finally determined the species of orchid through thorough analysis of pollen, investigators soon discovered a fundamental flaw in their methods. Many orchids have long since lost their stigmas, which means they simply produce pollen without any need for an organ or hormone to do it."
387,707,"For hundreds of years orchids have been prized discoveries of the botanical world and few have produced as much awe-inspiring beauty and beauty as this purple-capped crocus species. Crocus carpocapsa, or alder, was rarely seen in the wild as people knew them. After becoming a regional favorite in the United States in the mid-1800s it spread throughout the world. Its blooming is heralded by waves of vibrant purple blooms and bands of red blossom edged in purple. Flowering is commonly 6 to 14 weeks later than many other flowers, so the crocus is best seen from March to June."
458,808,"Astronaut wives were pressured by NASA, their husbands, and their sons and dads to enroll in the special training program. As soon as they went through the signing procedure, they became young women in no man's land, having gone without love, security, and a family for the good of science. ""We began to make the wrong choices,"" says Carol Rosin, a NASA social worker at the time. The astronaut wives endured myriad hardships, from helping the men do spacewalks to self-improvement. ""You're forced to push yourself to go outside and not sit back,"" Lillo says. """

In NASA's catalog of reference materials, there is a special file titled ""How to Get Married to an Astronaut,"" which refers to married astronaut wives as, ""the supporting cast of an ensemble"" and ""men just as strong and independent as their wives. Because they are encouraged to marry as they join the ranks of the astronaut family, a successful marriage for many NASA astronauts is thus extremely difficult to achieve.""15 Most NASA wives have married non-astronauts because their husbands wished them to do so."
446,808,"Astronaut wives were pressured by NASA, their husbands, and their children to keep quiet about having husbands on the craft. In this way they were forced to silence themselves. ""They told me they were going to expose me. They said if I told anyone, they would kill my husband and all my children. And they wouldn't tell me where he was. They wouldn't tell me when he was going to return."" In the early years of the program, women were able to train and provide each other with information about space travel."

492,808,"Astronaut wives were pressured by NASA, their husbands, and their husbands' families to accept a new work environment that was going to have them sit and lay in bed and do nothing at all, and sometimes go home at night, find a rock and dust it off. They saw an opportunity to get the rest they needed by just sitting there. They decided that was far superior to sitting in a lot of chairs in a room. I guess being a sissy like the rest of us has nothing to do with it."

546,1010,"Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the rain-driven mechanism of deposition began some 10 to 14 million years ago, by the long division of ice sheets and is continuing today, as the Mediterranean Sea's dramatic climate swings, with mild winters and longer and shorter summers. When the glacier is retreating, water piles up under the glacier, creating a small reservoir (the little mountain you see in the picture above), which can remain inactive for many years. At the same time, temperature variations also cause the ice to contract and expand, carrying additional meltwater to the valley below."
577,1010,"Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the Appalachian Mountains, which stretch from Maine to North Carolina, have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years. ""The Appalachian Mountains are extremely dry,"" said Judson L. Semmens, an Appalachian geologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. ""They're deep, meaning they're more than a thousand feet beneath the surface. When people talk about dry, they're talking about very dry. It's getting to the point where we can think about how the soil moves, which would mean that the soil overlying the Appalachian Mountains is basically a rock."
584,1010,"Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the Chicxulub impact event happened between 65 million and 145 million years ago. After the asteroid hit, the Chicxulub crater was roughly 2.2 miles in diameter and up to 1,800 feet deep. The impact caused a 2.6-mile high tidal wave and a four-mile wide crater containing all the rock and soil from which the ocean would later form. This ""super-eruption"" created over 600 square miles of new land. By comparison, the Black Sea is just around 20 square miles. Geologists believe an even bigger impact crater may have formed at the Sea's mouth."
579,1010,"Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the crater formed over a hundred million years ago in an area with very cold temperatures and a very dry crust. In fact, scientists say that impact debris would have to have been transported to the moon very rapidly, with barely any time to cool. Many ancient tidal waves created by explosive eruptions of magma on Mercury among other places have brought ice deposits to Earth today, for example. Over millions of years, a sharp limit has been reached in the ice shelf's exposed thickness. Before this was reached, a """

The mammoth's remains, which were found in 2007 near the Russian city of Novosibirsk, were being studied at the Mammoth Site and Science Center in Siberia. A T-Rex skeleton was found on a Native American burial ground nearby, and scientists think it was covered in whale skin. Other remnants of the beast, including flipper marks, muscled vertebrae and soft tissues, were pulled up and studied in museums around the world."
620,1111,"The closest relative of the woolly mammoth is the Asian elephant, which inhabited Asia for thousands of years before the domestication of cattle began in the 10th century. Domesticating cattle, however, proved to be more difficult than domestication of the woolly mammoth. Domesticating the mammoth posed a whole host of new challenges to farmers who were used to cattle all day long and with the multiple consumption of meat, animal protein consumption in human diets plummeted. This was only to be made worse by the astonishing fat, resistant butterfat milk produced by the European sheep in the 17th century."

708,1313,"Antarctica has just two seasons: summer and winter. Antarctica has beautiful landscapes of glaciers, deep valleys and snow fields and valleys of frozen water. Antarctica has the longest summer daylight hours of any continent - up to 14 hours longer than the equator. As a result of the temperature change from summer to winter, summers are often short - 6 to 10 days - and winters often long - 23 to 29 days. This means Antarctica experiences climate changes about once a year. As much as people like to think of Antarctica as a barren wasteland of ice, that is very far from the truth."
692,1313,"Antarctica has just two seasons: summer and winter. Antarctica has 23 major lakes, one of which is Mead. See the map above for Mead's latitude and longitude. Mead is a small-mouthed hydrothermal vent system located 1,500 meters below the surface. It was formed from an initial venting event and has subsequently been continuously enlarged by dissolving magma. It is thus constantly receiving fresh magma to expand and contract, forming veins and channels that flow for miles. You'll see magma seen in Yellowstone. It is constantly cooling. As the magma cools, it forms fractures and, when these fractures open up, the magma splits off and escapes."
683,1313,"Antarctica has just two seasons: summer and winter. Antarctica has no cycle. That means there's no known way that this region of the world could possibly experience any significant amount of rainfall. That isn't to say that there are no habitable places, the world is getting drier and the majority of Antarctica is literally on a slow decline due to warming from global warming. The amount of precipitation that has to come through Antarctica varies and it depends on the size of the ice sheets, the amount of sunlight that reaches the ice, and whether the ice faces in the wind."
677,1313,"Antarctica has just two seasons: summer and winter. Antarctica has only one broad category of climate: the Antarctic Climate. The Antarctic Climate is the average of all six possible climate extremes in a particular season: the AmundsenScott South Pole Station Climate, the Harrisonburg Climate, the McMurdo Station Climate, the Lake Vostok Climate, and the South Pole Climate. As you might expect, Antarctica is constantly and rapidly changing. In fact, it is the only continent where the weather patterns vary from season to season. Each season has its own unique environment, and so its weather pattern is also unique. Antarctica is constantly changing."
700,1313,"Antarctica has just two seasons: summer and winter. Antarctica has frequent warm up periods and a shortage of sunlight to make ice, which makes it quite common for people to think that all the snow has gone to Antarctica. The actual trend is quite different. Antarctica holds a significant volume of snow over the summer, and that snow falls in the southern hemisphere and makes it to the freezing surface of the earth in the winter. Antarctica can get above freezing temperatures up to 50% of the time in the winter, and there's a significant peak in the winters when Antarctic weather is abnormally cold."

839,1515,"During puberty, boys experience a greater increase in muscular strength. Increasing testosterone levels during puberty increases the libido and stimulates sexual maturation, and the size and strength of the musculature in boys increase. A better understanding of the role of testosterone in muscle development during puberty is important for sports medicine. The aims of this review are to summarize recent studies on the influence of sex steroids in development of skeletal muscle and to make a short review of the recent research using genetically modified mice in sports medicine."
823,1515,"During puberty, boys experience a greater increase in muscular strength and size than girls. This upward trend in muscle size, along with a subsequent increase in aerobic capacity, make males more athletic than females. As a consequence, boys are often less attracted to sports than girls. This is reflected in the lower participation rate of young men in sports than the general population. In addition, young men are more likely to drop out of physical education classes and drop out of sports classes. Why Are So Many Young Men Drop Out of Physical Education Classes?"
791,1515,"During puberty, boys experience a greater increase in muscular strength, power, and endurance than do girls. However, it has long been recognized that the contribution of testosterone to these increases in strength and power is weaker than that of estrogen. Since exercise is one of the greatest known sources of both estrogen and testosterone, the critical question is whether or not these increases in strength are actually sex-differentiated. If so, this might be explained by the increased ratio of the testosterone-to-estrogen concentrations in the muscle (70 to 1) observed in postmenopausal men."
797,1515,"During puberty, boys experience a greater increase in muscular strength (both the absolute and relative strength), resulting in greater measures of force output. Each kilogram of stored muscle will be approximately 2-3 times stronger than before puberty. A sample of the world's best sprinting athletes revealed that the maximum power output on a slow, rising step was around 28 watts per kilogram, or an equivalent to approximately the power output of 12+ kg for both boys and girls. It is, however, unclear if these peak power estimates are absolute or relative measurements."
825,1515,"During puberty, boys experience a greater increase in muscular strength, aerobic capacity, and body fatness (6). Similarly, girls achieve higher rates of weight loss during puberty than do boys. The fat stores of most girls tend to increase from adolescence to adulthood (7). However, women tend to regain greater amounts of body fat after weight loss than do men (8). The most striking feature of teenage boys is their greater propensity for weight gain than do teenage girls (9). The role of changes in energy balance during puberty in controlling the magnitude of this change is unclear."

988,1818,"The Civilian Conservation Corps was a group of young men who worked in the rural areas of the US. They spent six weeks on a farm, learning to work with the land. One of their tasks was to cultivate the land to supply wild game for the hounds. The students suffered from malnutrition, they worked all day, and were responsible for the health of the hunters' hounds. This particularly insulted the hunters, so they took some of the students hostage and starved them to death. The well-known stories of this cruelty led to reform of the Civilian Conservation Corps program."

950,1818,"The Civilian Conservation Corps was a group of young men who got their work experience with the Civilian Conservation Corps at the Chicago post office. The CCC also provided unemployment and educational training to young men who had been excluded from the regular work force. The term CCC was short for Civilian Conservation Corps, and it came from the fact that the participants had not attended a public school. In the early 1930s, if you couldn't find a job, it was helpful if you could work for a government agency. President Herbert Hoover created the CCC for two reasons."

It was a secret test of the player's honesty, and was meant to show the opponent his own dishonesty. Here's the first game. The ball is seven foot long, and one foot is five feet."
1281,2424,"The ball game, called pok-a-tok, was sacred to the Maya. It was originally played on large trees, on hillsides and a few toads drifted through the ground. You could smell them while trying to hit the ball with a high brick - just like a toad dipped into some earth. The ball was bounced from one to the other, and it bounced into a pipe, a bucket or a tree trunk. Everyone knew the game - it is played with groups of kids on one side, a monkey on the other side, which would swing the ball to get it closer."
1286,2424,"The ball game, called pok-a-tok, was sacred to the Maya. The drums, called mehanas, were like thunder. My grandparents knew everything there was to know about the game, and they were dying to take me to see it. My mom packed me off to the Flying V museum, which I had never been to. It was gigantic: a field with seven infields, each with a fan zone, glass breakers, a pitcher's mound, and two towering walls topped with giant multicolored-wood panels. A patchwork of American flags and stars flew from the mast of one of the museum's twin giant-conical clouds."

They had to be escorted by security forces,"" said deputy Israeli ambassador Dan Arno, adding that this situation had been eased by the Israelis' decision to release some of the detainees. Mr Arno said the Israeli president's office had received the group of asylum seekers at his apartment and had moved them on to a police van. They were driven to Ramallah for questioning, where they were freed after giving statements. ""We knew what to expect."
1331,2525,"At first, the military did not want to let civilians leave the city. Initially, the army sent civilian experts and started using the underground tunnels. The military knew this way was more vulnerable because with the rebels only a few kilometers away, they feared that they would attack once the civilian experts were gone. Once the tunnel workers were out of the city, the government was able to declare the city safe. During a discussion about looting, Garing Abed explained that he and his family had lived in the city for 18 years."
1371,2525,"At first, the military did not want to let civilians go there. ""They didn't want us to go,"" Sanjeev says. But the climate created by the earthquake, he says, made the opposite argument. ""The military said, if we don't send you, this is the government's responsibility. We can't just let people go because of fear,"" he says. ""Now they don't say that anymore. They've come with a new argument."" On June 8, the Indian government quietly lifted its ban on reporting to the quake zone, sparking a flood of people."
1351,2525,"At first, the military did not want to let civilians work on the reconstruction of Gaza. Local activists said that this decision was in line with Israeli policies to destroy Gaza as a whole, rather than focus on rebuilding the most damaged areas. Notably, humanitarian aid groups, including UNRWA, had demanded that Israel allow NGOs to aid in reconstruction before engaging in any reconstruction work in Gaza. Nizar Ayyoub, who is a lawyer with Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, said that if Israeli soldiers also benefit from the work, this puts all workers in jeopardy."
1366,2525,"At first, the military did not want to let civilians participate in the operation. But the war turned to a civil war with anti-government forces and Russia killing about 2,000 civilians.

The Ukrainians won, the US and EU lent them $3 billion and sanctions against Russia were implemented.

2108,3636,"The plane swooped lower as they neared the Austin airport. Suddenly, they came to a stop. The Los Angeles Airport was ahead of them and the cabin shook and shook in anticipation. The love potion was out. The plane took off. The airport did not look big. They were the only ones in the sky and there was little traffic. Suddenly, the ground stopped shaking. The aircraft came to a landing. I stood there thinking I had just witnessed the miracle. The two men were standing with their backs to me. I spoke to them for a long time afterwards."
2076,3636,"The plane swooped lower as they neared the Austin airport. ""I can't believe it's about to happen,"" Richardson said. ""But, yeah, this is really crazy."" The plane not only dropped the second strike but also drop a bomb directly on the runway, causing the landing to be aborted and have the entire assembly trapped. An hours-long standoff ensued during which the two hostages were moved several times to outside the plane. By the end, all of the five were on their feet and unharmed, but the plane was damaged. ""It was like the Willy Wonka Factory down here,"" said one witness."
2062,3636,"The plane swooped lower as they neared the Austin airport. Johnson, wearing a black cowboy hat and cowboy boots, carried a scowl on his face. He gave the plane a sideways left hand turn as he waited for me to board. The interior was a sterile space with no signs that the plane had traveled very far and was about to be in a world of trouble. Johnson was a silent man; he took notes, but didn't talk much. But when the plane made the first stop, in Clear Lake, he jumped into the cockpit and led the way into the deep."
2075,3636,"The plane swooped lower as they neared the Austin airport. The front tires seemed to slide in and out, as if in slow motion. The second they were half a mile away, the clutch came up. The plane was under control and flew straight, keeping pace with the incoming cars, at roughly 400 mph. One after another, everyone inside spun out, their systems quitting. The place began to shiver and shake, and many in the ground crew stood holding their arms out like fishermen waving fishing rods. If they had hoped the rest of the airplane wouldn't be so dangerous, they were wrong."
2129,3737,"As I entered the little cafe on the north side of Edinburgh's Royal Mile, I noticed a sign board that bore a striking resemblance to Thomas Edison's Unitarian Church of America sign. It was a ""wellspring of knowledge,"" not to mention an official way to get your coffee without anyone's help. The cafe was owned by an elderly gentleman who had seen the sign by the roadside and had long wished to recreate it at home. He borrowed the Tardis logo from a long-forgotten ""magic bean"" tin. Like the sign, the cafe was a take on a familiar one, using original elements to make something distinctly his own."
2124,3737,"As I entered the little cafe on the north side of the island, a half dozen baristas were lining up a cup of coffee. While I watched, the cook passed around a hand-made tarte tatin and showed off the truffle butter available in that tartan tin. I'm not a tarte tatin aficionado, but I wasn't going to pass up a free tarte tatin. I asked the owner to bring over a few. When the tarte tatin arrived, I just couldn't resist it. I've been searching for a deep-dish mushroom-pizza-cookie crust that isn't too chewy, as I like to think of the crust as an extension of the mushroom and cookie."
2116,3737,"As I entered the little cafe on the north side of town, I smelled freshly baked goods from Le Grand Red Courthouse pastry shop, straight from the oven. When I got to the counter, the hostess brought out a giant flower from the outside of her window, and on the outside of her window another one. Inside her window, a drawing was hanging on her wall, a drawing of a masked woman with what I assume is the Emperor's cup and saucer, her arms crossed. The painting was from a Belgrade cartoon, a great comment on the might of the communist regime."
2153,3737,"As I entered the little cafe on the north side of the mall, where I was greeted by a lit-up sign and greeted by a pink-haired young woman who greeted me, she gave me a big hug. As I took pictures with the bright and colorful hostesses, I asked, ""Is this hostess just here to pretend to help me with my luggage or is she actually helping me?"" The girl in a pink top stepped forward and said, ""As a female, you may have to let other people help you carry your bags. If you'd like to ask them, then you can stand behind the table with your bags."
2112,3737,"As I entered the little cafe on the north side of Cardiff Castle, I tried to ignore the delicious food I was receiving from the lovely staff. Every time I went in, they had something delicious. It was almost like I was in a hole in the ground. I spotted a book by Gerald Scarfe (a Welsh author). He wrote about a boy named Lloyd who ended up in south Wales. I wrote in his book and gave him the address to write to me. I began to read the book and eventually saw the address written on the paper underneath my face."
2215,3838,"It was the hottest day of the year. As Malai complained about how his foot was hurting and begged for a cool drink, me and some of the other customers got up to give him one of those to sate his thirst. What we didn't know, though, is that the glass he was holding was a bulletproof shield. When I picked up the cardboard container, it was home to a bulletproof helmet. The container itself was a bulletproof vest. A young boy, maybe around 11 or 12, was sitting in front of the container when Malai handed it over."
2214,3838,"It was the hottest day of the year. As Malai walked across the parking lot and past a large display of Muslim religious itemssuch as the black skullcap worn by many Lahore University studentsshe encountered the most extreme greeting of the day. ""Yes, this is the place where you should hate Muslims. This is where you should say this is the place where you should hate Hindus and nobody will hate you,"" a young man shouted to her as he jostled with the other shoppers for space. ""That place is where the most of Pakistanis will be."
2212,3838,"It was the hottest day of the year. As Malai went home from the bridge to the house, I asked him what happened. He put down the stone and told me: ""Four days ago the Sun came out, the Moon came out, and the stars came out of the sky."" The reader knows where this ends. The real news is that Malai held a consultation with a well-known elder of a temple in his territory, who prepared a medicine for his problems. I saw the medicine that night in my tent and my feelings for Malai were aroused."
2221,3838,"It was the hottest day of the year. As Malai makes his rounds during the glory period, he notices a small book set on the table. He takes it and opens to the first page. It is a little book, made of thick paper. Malai remembers this back when he was a little boy. He stared at it, curious. He started to read the first chapter and came back. He slowly read it over again and again. It was an exciting journey. We discover that this book is called all things. Malai saw something interesting on the page. A pretty shape."
2189,3838,"It was the hottest day of the year. As Malai Chen, one of the scientists on the team, put it, ""I was about to give up."" The ground that he had worked so hard to plant, work that he said made his family in India proud, was now gone. India is one of the world's largest rice producers, and every year the government of India, through the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, redistributes more than $4 billion of watermelons to countries like Pakistan and Vietnam, even though they are located closer to India's agricultural areas and also have a larger area of fertile rice land."
2275,3939,"It was a stormy Thursday evening, much like any other, the students living in the dormitory for the summer semester, all twenty-one of them, were lying in their beds, half-ass asleep. Still, the last few minutes of the evening passed in silence, three women, warm drinks in hand, just taking a chance to slip away quietly, each for a different reason. ""Umm, Li-be,"" Yang started as the door swung open. ""Yang-Sun is"" ""I know,"" Blake gave her a sly smile, her hand covering her mouth."
2243,3939,"It was a stormy Thursday evening, much like any other, when a wave of tourists crashed into Seattle's North Beach park. Garry Jackson was at the seawall when it was hit hard. He stood on the crowd, which was moving slowly to safety, to see if anyone was injured. ""What they hit was like a tsunami,"" said Jackson. A music festival was taking place on the seawall but organizers changed plans early Friday afternoon to cancel it as more tourists arrived."
2237,3939,"It was a stormy Thursday evening, much like any other, but for one central Ohio family, it turned into a nightmare when their home was swept away by a flash flood. But, while flooding is always terrifying, for some families it's a very real threat. This is when a flash flood can happen in America, when a powerful storm hits, then the water rushes in quickly. Watch the report The Medina Water Department says because of the strong storm, high water washed over the house."
2265,3939,"It was a stormy Thursday evening, much like any other, when I walked down the main street in Fayetteville, N.C. As I was rounding a corner and looking into a boarded-up gas station, I spotted a white pit bull dog running through the parking lot. I was immediately frightened by its unusually large size and horrible demeanor, and so I hopped into my car and sped out of there as fast as my 9-year-old tires would carry me."
2239,3939,"It was a stormy Thursday evening, much like any other, when I finally made it to the hotel. And, as you can imagine, as soon as I woke up to get my bearings, I was ready for my first close-up look at Winston Churchill. Easily one of the most influential and complex men of modern times, Churchill was born in London, the fourth of five children. He entered the Army in 1917 at the age of 21 and rose to the rank of brigadier."
2343,4040,"I had an apartment in the Margareten district. Though the 5-star hotels in town were like islands, here was a crowded, well-maintained area with windows and balconies. There was a courtyard with a family living there. Our thoughts turned to that little scene. Hate Rotten From the time we arrived at the apartment we decided to remove any normal environmental components, things like heater and air conditioner, out of our house. It was not long before we heard a single scream. The neighbors were not far away, but they did not get it immediately. The screams are usually small children who fear something in their house."
2321,4040,"I had an apartment in the Margareten district. Though the risk was obvious to me in Amsterdam, I chose to do it. I chose a big city because I knew I would eventually move, maybe to London. I had planned my career before I bought the house, too. I knew I would be in the arts and for my study, I was going to do music in a major city. But I had to learn quickly. The culture shock began when I moved to London. I realized very quickly that I had to give up all my identities."
2320,4040,"I had an apartment in the Margareten district. Though the night was getting shorter, it was hot. One evening at 6 pm, I had invited some of the neighbors over for a light dinner, which turned into an hour-long game of Scrabble. When we were done, a young man approached me. He looked like he had been walking around a lot lately. His skin was pocked and his eyes made of sandstone. His hair was pulled tight back to hide his colorful silk scarf. The scarf covered his face as he waited to be introduced to my family."
2331,4040,"I had an apartment in the Margareten district. Though the sky had started to grow darker, we knew it was still early in the morning. ""So here's the plan,"" Lei Yu declared as he gazed at his handiwork, ""we'll split up into teams, and we'll take turns hiding. When the sun starts to rise, I'll come out and nab the enemy here with my red-robed Fanatic. Then, once all of you get together, you'll send a distress call. Finally, I'll hide myself with Xuan Yuan Po, and we'll jointly deal with the assassins and the vanguard. Let's get started!"" ""Wait a minute!"
2302,4040,"I had an apartment in the Margareten district. Though the 1960s were much gentler, there was still a lot of racism. I remember seeing a black man sitting outside his home in the evening and I remember thinking, ""Good heavens."" Sticking it to the man R.A.D. designed a line of graffiti art: Ghetto A, a frank depiction of a black man a 'hood thug with the word ""nigger"" written in large black letters on the side of his face. He was the most unusual person in the art school at the time. It was an experimental project with a lot of potential."
2370,4141,"I've been intimately familiar with Dan's since I played my first Pokmon game, which, coincidentally enough, happened to be on the original Gameboy. Pokmon is still my favorite video game of all time, and that means the Nintendo 64 was the system I played the game best. And my first Pokmon was Moltres. To put that in perspective, that's probably more than a half-million people. So, naturally, I was very excited to learn that Dan was thinking about making a Moltres retelling for the SNES."
2412,4141,"I've been intimately familiar with Dan's since I played my first Pokmon game back in the original Generation. He has a lot of good things to say about the game and the characters, but there are also a couple of things he says that I actually agree with and think might be good ideas for Pokmon as a whole. So today I'm talking to you about weird ideas, really, strange ideas that I think are the best ideas to come out of Pokmon."
2375,4141,"I've been intimately familiar with Dan's since I played my first game of Netrunner with him as a member of the Manhattan 4.) I was curious as to how well the top players in the game perform when they are ""out of their comfort zone."" Using an actual level rating (median) from a 24-player tournament last year, I found this table to provide the following statistics. These numbers may not reflect how players perform when playing in highly populated events, where the competitiveness is typically higher."
2388,4141,"I've been intimately familiar with Dan's since I played my first Warhammer 40k tournament with him in the late 80s and early 90s (wars of the future). Most of the people that we ran with back then kept a very close eye on his game mechanics. The big secret at the time was that he was on a fairly tight budget. That may sound like a dis-empowering thing, but it actually made the environment completely different from what we're used to today."
2360,4141,"I've been intimately familiar with Dan's since I played my first game with him, which was a D&D playtest in about 2006. He's been one of my favorite designers ever since, since I discovered his system, Mutant Future, in 1999. Dan will be the lead designer of this game. He's worked on a number of early D&D games, and he's a true wizard, having written a number of long-running world-building supplements as well as countless example D&D adventures. We'll be publishing most of his output in various editions of Mutant Future."
2424,4242,"Paul and Jimmy thought long and hard about what kind of football we should play. But there was no reason for us to give up an already successful start and the stadium to the team from Wisconsin. Also, no one on our staff had ever coached in Washington DC, only on the west coast. And no one wanted to go into a new town without coaching for a while. ""Every other town we have gone to has been done in a fairly short period of time, usually two years or so,"" says Jim Snyder, the tight ends coach for an earlier Washington Redskins team in Washington."
2429,4242,"Paul and Jimmy thought long and hard about what kind of friend and mentor Karl Malone would be. (1:05) Karl Malone had only one job when he was introduced to Magic Johnson at a charity basketball game in Los Angeles in 2007: Greet Magic. Malone, whose goal was to provide Johnson and Johnson's Lakers teammates with ""a little excitement,"" knew this was an opportunity long lost. ""I said, 'Tell Karl I'm a very happy man today. Please let him know,' "" Johnson said. ""I had met John Stockton years before. I was friends with Magic, I thought, but I've never seen him."
2433,4242,"Paul and Jimmy thought long and hard about what kind of music they were making, and from there it was a matter of deciding which angle we wanted to go with first. How'd you decide on a ""Jimmy and the Techs"" angle? Jimmy: We liked the fact that John and Paul were both musicians and we knew that they wanted to be involved with something that would capture the essence of Paul's performance. Paul knew the world of theatrics, and we wanted to replicate that aspect of their performance. Did that also give you a more relaxed approach?"
2451,4242,"Paul and Jimmy thought long and hard about what kind of video they would create and specifically for a company like mine, I said my name over and over so I could be recognizable in this day and age. I guess he figured out that I'm their type of guy. As you guys know, there were certain scenes with two girls with a storyline that we couldn't do on a series. The real thing is that, at that time, I had the role of the protagonist and it was a tough role to crack in the games industry."
2445,4242,"Paul and Jimmy thought long and hard about what kind of people we wanted to bring with us. I am a biological son of Scottish immigrants, and growing up in all the high school Spanish-language classes, we talked about the importance of not letting people forget their roots. It is both a reference to Donald Trump's ill-advised ""Polish Americans"" comment and to the important political, cultural, and social differences among immigrant groups in this country. We didn't want a white kids' show, so our main characters are Latino, Arab, African-American, and an odd Japanese boy who's been living here for a few years."
2524,4343,"Joey had difficulty falling asleep the night before the Columbia tragedy. Knowing that she would have to sleep in the hospital her family had booked her in for, my husband told her to call when she was done. I took her place. Joey could not concentrate on anything without the TV on. She had her pillow and blanket around her head to ""let off some steam"". I could not sleep because I knew she was too frightened to sleep. She kept whispering ""Is he coming home?"". I always hoped he would, and always worried that he would not."
2522,4343,"Joey had difficulty falling asleep the night before the Columbia University hockey game. He gets queasy easily, even after a cup of coffee. So maybe he knew what was coming. He sat bolt upright, his eye rolled into the back of his head. Maybe in that instant, he wondered how many more collisions that night would bring. But it was not until he dropped to the floor,, drooling, that he could truly begin to comprehend what he was facing. All over the suite, things started coming apart. Pipes cracked. Lampclerk's belted goatee fell off. Some wall coverings were bent."
2504,4343,"Joey had difficulty falling asleep the night before the Columbia tragedy. With her family and friends in the house, there were plenty of distractions. ""She stayed up really late,"" Sam said. ""She just couldn't fall asleep. She didn't feel any different. She had done it before."" Jake was awake throughout the day, too. It was more than just the drama of what might happen, from wild claims of fault to all of the details that made the deaths even more tragic. It was also the personal pain. When asked how Joey felt, Michael said, ""For her, she would have been terrified."
2500,4343,"Joey had difficulty falling asleep the night before the Columbia disaster and confessed this to HR. He kept asking HR to let him sleep in an extra hour, to no avail. No-one could do anything to help him get some sleep and probably, none of them were trying to help him anyway. Personally, I would have preferred for him to sleep in his office as a sign of sympathy. He could have at least asked to stay up in his office at 12:30pm and slept until 7pm the next day. Just something to note. I wonder how many times my colleagues saw Joey and said, """
2476,4343,"Joey had difficulty falling asleep the night before the Columbia disaster, and eventually slept for two straight hours. On Saturday morning, after a ten hour ride, he returned to his apartment for the first time in six days. He tore off his black leather jacket and threw it on the floor. He threw his brown pants into the laundry basket, and put on his black hiking boots. He started over. It wasn't easy. ""That morning was the hardest I've ever had to endure,"" he said. The bus had descended to the river's west bank and was standing still in the sludge on its way out."
2595,4444,"The earthworm wriggled, the now-severed halves of its long, purple-and-red body in many disparate places. Meanwhile, Star Butterfly's stomach was continuing to grow... Who had to go first? That night in the church, Twilight had pondered the question over and over again. Over and over. Maybe. But the night grew darker... The light in the sky grew dimmer... The birds died, and the voices of her friends grew so quiet she had no idea how long they had been talking."
2561,4444,"The earthworm wriggled, the now-severed halves of its long, purple-and-red body bobbed up and down. ""What about Her?"" said Tylin. ""I don't know."" The earthworm twitched in the grass. ""I'll be right back."" He hurried back over the peak. He wasn't going to go to the inn anymore. She was coming to see him again, he was sure of that. He turned to go to the inn. He looked up, to see just past him a red glimmer. """
2589,4444,"The earthworm wriggled, the now-severed halves of its long, purple-and-red carapace cared back and forth, before it flew out of sight, bounced down the cliffs, and disappeared into the darkness. There was a weirdness in its gait, which didn't feel right, somehow. And now there was something familiar about the movements. It was like that movements of the farmhand The owner of the land and his crop had arrived. He had picked up the order from a courier, then waited quietly by the window."
2580,4444,"The earthworm wriggled, the now-severed halves of its long, purple-and-red body making a sound like water in a sieve. The castle swayed as Jann was dragged along by the earthworm. The purple sheen on the dark grey stone gave the staircases a speckled appearance. By the time they reached the lowest floor, they were almost dragged down by the earthworm. The wizard grinned as he watched Jann go through the first floor door. ""What are you doing here, boys?"" """
2554,4444,"The earthworm wriggled, the now-severed halves of its long, purple-and-red-striped body bobbed to and fro. ""No,"" the sun-born ogre grunted.

2611,4545,"They turned off the street and started up the narrow trail. I couldn't help it: I became just as excited, but on another level. I had somehow found a way to spend an entire afternoon with the real Vermont, which was exactly the kind of thing I'd been looking for. There were no beds, no couches, no sushi. It was just a trail, a simple path that led up and down side-by-side switchbacks, crossed by shallow streams that carried muddy, brackish water into the surrounding woods. Soaked in the mud, I had to lay my towel down."
2630,4545,"They turned off the street and started up the narrow path to his apartment and as soon as they got there, Sun Yi Xue started getting restless. Although he was polite and asked when they came to request for the horse for entertainment, she only blinked her eyes at him and only said, ""It's late."" How could he not know that she did not want to share the horse with him. ""Please allow me to use the horse in your place,"" he said, touching her shoulder. She replied with a snort, ""You don't need to ask me. You brought the horse here."
2657,4545,"They turned off the street and started up the narrow curving alley way, she waved to her parents as they entered. If she didn't know better, she'd think they were afraid. And that's just how Bella had been trained to be. It had made her much colder, the nerves around her making her face flush with heat. But still the pull to fling her hands into the air in a defiant little wave had never left her. Still there had always been the shadow of the wild huntress that should have been suppressed by the dangers of the city."
2604,4545,"They turned off the street and started up the narrow drive. The noise of rushing footfalls could be heard below them. Reaching the kitchen doors, he stood a few feet away from them, looking out. ""John?"" Mary's voice came from behind him. Without thinking, John turned to look back. ""Oh shit,"" he heard the boy say. He was literally in awe. He stared for a few more moments, his jaw hanging open. He looked down again and saw her standing, a cup of coffee in her hands. ""Mary?"" he said, a second too late. Her eyes widened. ""What's wrong?"" John swallowed. """

2701,4646,"Ron Gonzales and I didn't like each other from the beginning, but there were two central differences that at least remained throughout the entire year. The first was Gonzales' setup of the offense. I would really say that he didn't like to call long ball plays. Sure, it was necessary to get pressure on teams, but as your team is winning the ball back, why would you risk scoring a goal if the goal is likely a tie?"
2690,4646,"Ron Gonzales and I didn't like each other from the beginning but I knew he was not a problem,"" he said. ""He was just trying to do his job and I was trying to do mine. He's very hard on himself. But that's one of the things that's frustrating about his job and his life. It's also frustrating when it's up to him to make the call as opposed to calling me. He's got to look at his boss."

I've been with other teams in Major League Soccer, I have very good relationship with the owners, with the front office, with the players. I like the players. I like the staff. I like the staff.

And I was lectured on how that was the worst thing to believe in.I wouldn't have any memories of the times I lived in America. The first thing I'd think of was socialism."

This obviously left the script music writing to such writers as Tony Cliff, Thomas Bradbury, Rick Moody, Harry Spencer, and John Schaff.

He spoke to Tatsuya in a speechless tone, ""Is this something that you want to do, Tatsuya-kun?"" Tatsuya gave him a bewildered stare. He looked around, trying to identify what Tatsuya meant, but didn't know how to respond."

Upon their arrival at the bar, the two found themselves chatting, soon becoming a couple. Alex paused the video to take a look at her, who was clad in one of her typical skimpy outfits, with the men for some reason being so into it that they were practically standing. After catching her gaze, he motioned for her to continue. ""We've got something else in common, with my sister."

2897,4949,"Something must be going on, Manuel thought as he stood there, side by side with the High Alchemist toying with his spear. He couldn't quite figure out what, but he knew that he wanted to know it. Of course, that desire was most likely just another distraction; waiting for the time when he could strike back and deny his enemy the satisfaction of an answer. Instead, he felt the chill of what may be his enemy's stone sword. A faint hiss had been sounded from the weapon and it seemed to be slowly rotating."
2856,4949,"Something must be going on, Manuel thought as he stood under the tree. Now that he had not been playing anymore, he could not remember. Or maybe the trees had actually disappeared? But somehow, it had been just fine. And now, he was standing outside in the cold, silently rubbing at his arm. He didn't care who was on the other side of the wall, right now, but he just wanted to take the day as it came. As it had arrived, and his legs could stand it no more."

2853,4949,"Something must be going on, Manuel thought as he stood up. He waited for the guards to appear on the porch with guns raised. There was no need. They were already too far away. He sighed. This was it. The perfect place to turn around and go back the way he came, the way his parents took him. Still, his stomach told him to break out of his paralysis. After all, even if he were to fall to his death from the second floor balcony, that would be the end of it."
2882,4949,"Something must be going on, Manuel thought as he stood at his water pump. His discomfort about the six-foot-four, 240-pound lineman growing into his frame seemed to vanish the minute a guard with perfectly straight muscles appeared out of nowhere, sprawled across a parking space. Of course, he would get used to it, he thought to himself. The mobility and balance the other linemen brought, even without the tools or savvy to set them, was all that made football worth playing. And it wouldn't be long before the position would become even easier."

3037,5151,"I had planned on using this one-hour train ride to catch my first shuttle to the stadium and visit my girlfriends for dinner, but I somehow wound up getting off in front of Red Bull Arena, forcing me to hop the fence back to the parking lot. That $30 ticket gets you in the door, and you can grab a meal right behind the press box. We ran through some of the best appetizers and then split some nachos (when that's what you call chicken and cheese on a sourdough) and taquitos. This isn't a party, people."
3027,5151,"I had planned on using this one-hour train ride to keep it light and lively until I got to the city, but it felt even more empty than before. What I've always enjoyed about this city is the abundance of funky and attractive places to eat, drink and socialize. Normally, every time I visit, I think to myself how there must be a dozen more places to go here. But this time, there seemed to be a decidedly smaller number. A few barflies at the rest stop looked like they were heading home."
3039,5151,"I had planned on using this one-hour train ride to check out the Palisades in the Hudson River Valley. The train made the trip in an hour and 10 minutes. So it's far enough away from everything else, but close enough to see places not far from a huge metropolitan area that may be viewed by many as America's best kept secret. But I had to do more than just hop on board the Amtrak train, go up to the Palisades, and experience that living history of creativity, speculation, and discovery."
3041,5151,"I had planned on using this one-hour train ride to get to Paris from New York. It also allowed me to extend my current trip that's taking me through several cities and can take more than one bus trip to the coast. I don't mind going by train if it's late enough, but it was getting a bit annoying during rush hour. I look forward to it now! The bottom line is that it's by far the cheapest of any train we've tried and the seats were often not air-conditioned. However, we do like the experience of traveling on rail transit."
3046,5151,"I had planned on using this one-hour train ride to catch the 90th run of the Triple Crown of Riding, the Fountainhead Trail Run, Saturday night. However, one word of caution to consider: My 40-something-year-old cyclist thought it was okay to put his scooter on a flat rail and scream as I traveled by. They definitely stopped the train but I think it was a robot. ""Oh, look at that giant idiot waving his arms,"" I thought. And I'm just saying the mere existence of giant idiots should be a red flag for Uber."
