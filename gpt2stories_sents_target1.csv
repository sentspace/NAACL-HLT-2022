0,1,"Montreal has a unique bagel tradition that dates back to at least 1919. The Montreal bagel is chewier, smaller, and less dense, but has a much bigger hole than its American cousin. Boiled in honey water and then baked in a wood-burning oven, it's a little sweet and has a harder exterior. It is hand-rolled in the shape of an oval hoop; you can wear one around your wrist like a bracelet.",1.0
101,203,"The human body is an ecosystem. We are home to thousands of kinds of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microscopic organisms, which number in the trillions. These organisms are called microbes. Together they form communities that make up theÂ human microbiome. Like fingerprints, no two human microbiomes are the same. That makes each person not just an ecosystem, but aÂ uniqueÂ ecosystem. Microbes first appeared over 3.5 billion years ago, making them the oldest form of life on Earth. Over the past six million years, humans and microbes have coevolved to form complex relationships.",1.0
202,405,"The Tang Dynasty started ruling in 618 A.D. Scholars generally believe the Tang Dynasty was one of the high points of Chinese civilization. One of the most influential technological innovations of the Tang Dynasty was woodblock printing. Woodblock printing is a technique for printing text, images or patterns. It involves cutting away at a block of wood until a pattern is created. The block could then be covered with ink, and applied to a paper or cloth to create the print.Â",1.0
303,607,"A group of researchers at Cornell University thinks the future of robots will actually be full of softbots. A softbot is simply a robot made out of soft tissue, so it can move more flexibly than a hard-bodied robot. And with the rise of 3D printers, building softbots is easier now than ever before. The question that remains is: what will these robots look like? How will they move? How will they carry things, or navigate small quarters? These are precisely the questions these scientists are trying to answer.Â",1.0
404,809,"Night blindness was a normal occurrence among pregnant women in the rural village in Nepal that Venkatesh Mannar visited in 2003. Living high in the mountains, the women he met risked their lives walking blindly in the dark on narrow mountain paths. ""There was a real danger of them falling down a cliff,"" he says. Mannar had traveled to the remote village to treat pregnant women with low doses of vitamin A capsules. After just two doses, the women regained their vision. Mannar's cure for night blindness was a scientific demonstration of the healing power of micronutrient supplements.",1.0
505,1011,"Almost all socializing, gaming, and work happened outdoors. A day in the life of an average Cahokian family involved spending most of the day working in the fields, fishing, and hunting. The women and girls probably tended the crops, snared some game, and collected greens, berries, and roots. The men and boys worked in the fields too, and made short hunting and fishing excursions to the lakes and forests within two- or three-days' walk of Cahokia.Â",1.0
606,1213,"The bilingual Shoshone woman Sacagawea (c. 1788 Ð 1812) accompanied the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery expedition in 1805-06 from the northern plains through the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean and back. Her skills as a translator were invaluable, as was her intimate knowledge of some difficult terrain. Perhaps most significant was her calming presence on both the expeditioners and the Native Americans they encountered, who might have otherwise been hostile to the strangers. Remarkably, Sacagawea did it all while caring for the son she bore just two months before departing.",1.0
707,1415,"For hundreds of years orchids have been prized discoveries of collectors and adventurers hoping to find new and exotic breeds of the flower. In her bookÂ The Orchid Thief, author Susan Orlean tells how in the 1800s orchids became popular in Europe, which made them very valuable. Many ""orchid hunters"" set out to find and bring back new types of orchids to sell. However, many of the men who went looking for the mysterious orchids met with tragedy instead. Orlean relates that ""dozens of hunters were killed by fever or accidents or malaria or foul play.""",1.0
808,1617,"Astronaut wives were pressured by NASA, their husbands, and their own sense of duty to display an outward image of family perfection. They had to smile their way through dealing with the fears for their spouses' safety and the challenges of maintaining a home and children with almost no help. It was a difficult path, but also served as the basis for the strong friendships that grew between the women. The astronauts' wives were in it together. The Houston suburbs where the wives made a home for their heroic husbands were called the ""Spaceburbs,"" or sometimes ""Togethersville.""",1.0
909,1819,"In the Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, one of the most amazing sights in the United States is dug into the side of a mountain. Sandy-colored towers, walls and rooms sit there, overlooking the park. They have no roofs, but the structures are protected by the overhanging cliff. Eight centuries after their construction, they are in excellent conditionÑand remain one of the most intriguing archaeological sites in the country. The largest of their dwellings, Cliff Palace, was discovered on December 18, 1888, by a pair of Colorado cowboys who were riding the mesa in search of missing cattle.",1.0
1010,2021,"Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the Colorado River has been flowing through the Grand Canyon for at least 17 million years, and it has been gradually shaping the canyon this entire time. The flowing water of the river and its tributaries has carved away at the rock of the Colorado Plateau, creating the sight we are familiar with today. Caves and caverns are another example of weathering and erosion. Limestone caves, such as the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, are formed when rainwater mixes with carbon dioxide in the ground and wears away at the limestone.",1.0
1111,2223,"The closest relative of the woolly mammoth is the Asian elephant. The main difference between the two is that the mammoth had an incredible coat of fur, made up of an outer layer of coarse ""guard hair"" with an inner layer of curly wool. The last known group of mammoths died off, or became extinct, around 4,000 years ago. The mammoth roamed the northern lands of the world during a period known as the Ice Age. It was among the largest land mammals to roam the earth. The mammoth was a tough beast and was able to endure extreme weather conditions and frigid temperatures.",1.0
1212,2425,"Reports from just over a year ago say that thousands of pythons have been making their homes in the Everglades at the expense of the native (natural to the area) species. Pythons and anacondas aren't normal inhabitants of the Florida ecosystem; the ones that have taken over the Everglades are ex-pets and their offspring. While it may seem cool that an exotic pet can survive on its own in an unfamiliar environment, these animals are unwelcome visitors.",1.0
1313,2627,"Antarctica has just two seasons: summer and winter. Antarctica has six months of daylight in its summer and six months of darkness in its winter. The seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis in relation to the sun. The direction of the tilt never changes. But as the Earth orbits the sun, different parts of the planet are exposed to direct sunlight. During summer, Antarctica is on the side of Earth tilted toward the sun and is in constant sunlight. In the winter, Antarctica is on the side of Earth tilted away from the sun, causing the continent to be dark.",1.0
1414,2829,"The Caribbean flamingos of Mexico are one of six flamingo species in the world. Members of that species also inhabit parts of southern Florida. Finding flamingos elsewhere in the world can be more challenging as some populations reside in remote locations and extreme environments, says Arengo. Flamingos have few problems with heat, cold, or altitude. ""They look dainty but are actually very rugged,"" she notes. In South America, flamingos live as high as 4,600 meters (about 15,000 feet) above sea level in the chilly heights of the Andes mountains.",1.0
1515,3031,"During puberty, boys experience a greater increase in muscular strength than girls do. When boys play certain sports, they tend to rely on the muscles at the back of their buttocks and legs and to flex their knees when they jump. Because girls' muscles aren't as strong as boys' muscles, girls rely more on the muscles at the front of their legs and tend to land with their legs straight. ""That puts additional stress on the knee joints,"" says Hewett. That extra stress can cause the knees to collapse inward, tearing the ACL.",1.0
1616,3233,"A vaccine is a safe germÑa normally harmful virus or bacterium that has been disabled or killed in the laboratory. Though the germ can no longer cause disease, when injected into the body it still prompts the immune system to create specially designed proteins called antibodies that destroy it. The immune system remembers that response and will mount it again if the body ever comes in contact with the harmful germ. Effective vaccines have been designed to prevent many infectionsÑamong them, mumps, measles, hepatitis, polio, various flus, and whooping cough.",1.0
1717,3435,"One of the keys that can often unlock a person+A221s memory is a specific sensory inputÑsomething you can see, smell, touch, taste, or hear. There is the famous case of the novelist Marcel Proust, who tasted a madeleineÑa kind of cookieÑand it caused him to suddenly remember an enormous amount of his childhood, memories that had previously been locked away. He went on to write a seven-volume novel called In Search of Lost Time, in which he explored these memories and what they meant to him. Proust might not have written these volumes exactly as they are had he not eaten that fateful madeleine.",1.0
1818,3637,"The Civilian Conservation Corps was a group of young men between the ages of 18 and 25 who were responsible for helping to keep safe and cultivate certain natural resources across the United States. The CCC was incredibly popular. It was very successful in boosting the morale, or sense of well-being, among its workers. These young men were paid $30 a month, sending $25 home to their parents. Living in camps, they worked to plant new trees, helped America's forests regrow, built roads, and made adjustments to the land to protect it from floods, fires and erosion.",1.0
1919,3839,"Books Through Bars advertises itself in magazines and pamphlets read by inmates. In the ads, they ask inmates to send them requests for books. So, the inmates write in and the volunteers then try to match the requests to books in the Books Through Bars library. Each inmate receives two or three books. When the volunteer has selected the books, he or she wraps them in paper cut from old grocery bags, writes the address of the jail or prison the inmate lives in on the front in black pen, and adds the package to a stack of packages to be mailed.",1.0
2020,4041,"Americans never elected Gerald R. Ford president or even vice presidentÑRichard Nixon appointed him after Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in October 1973. Today, Ford's brief presidency is often forgotten. Yet during Ford's two-and-a-half years, his wife, Betty, became the most controversial first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. Peddling their marriage as a ""normal"" partnership struggling with the challenges of modern family life, Betty Ford inserted herself at the flashpoint of the country's social upheavals. Her boldness may have cost her husband the presidency in 1976. The Fords were mismatched; he was square, she was hip. Still, the marriage worked.",1.0
2121,4243,"Solar power is simply the use of sunlight to create electricity. Machines that are capable of performing such a transformation use lenses or mirrors to harness all of the sunlight they can absorb into one concentrated beam. A process called the ""photoelectric effect"" strips electrons from out of the atoms that make up the rays of light, creating electricity. From that point on, the solar power electricity can be used for anything that typically needs an electric current: power tools, televisions, lighting, and air conditioning.",1.0
2222,4445,"The food of Thailand is very delicious. One of the most famous dishes is called Pad Thai. It is made of skinny noodles mixed with fried eggs, fish sauce, red chili pepper, bean sprouts, and can include chicken, shrimp, or tofu. It is very popular all over the world since many people love its flavors! Thai food uses a lot of seafood, since the country is located on the water. That's why fishing is so popular.

2323,4647,"The atmosphere surrounds the Earth and holds the air we breathe; it protects us from outer space; and holds moisture (clouds), gases, and tiny particles. In short, the atmosphere is the protective bubble in which we live. This protective bubble consists of several gases with the top four making up 99.998% of all gases. Of the dry composition of the atmosphere nitrogen, by far, is the most common. Nitrogen dilutes oxygen and prevents rapid burning at the Earth's surface. Living things need it to make proteins.",1.0
2424,4849,"The ball game, called pok-a-tok, was sacred to the Maya. It was an extension of their religion, and involved a great deal of ceremony. The game may have been a reenactment of the Maya myth of the Hero Twins. In the myth, the hero twins had to battle the gods of death from the underworld by playing a ball game. The ball is believed to represent the moon and the sun, and the court represents the earth. The ball was kept in the air, just as the sun and the moon were always in the sky. Many warriors and kings played the game fiercely.",1.0
2525,5051,"At first, the military did not want to let civilians use GPS, fearing that smugglers, terrorists, or hostile forces would use it. Finally, bowing to pressure from the companies that built the equipment, The Defense Department made GPS available for non-military purposes, with some restrictions. On May 1, 2000, President Clinton lifted the restrictions, and announced that the option to degrade civil GPS signals during emergencies would be phased out by 2010.

Soon he's sweeping down the curving face of the breaking wave, zigging and zagging ahead of the chasing white water. Then, suddenly, he veers back, zooms up the face of the wave, and launches into a dizzying aerial whirl. It's part 540-degree spin and part backflip, a wild rotation in two directions at once. Successfully landing the move, called a rodeo clown, Gudauskas scores a perfect 10.",1.0
2727,5455,"As the bright sun began to stream through her window, Maya lazily rubbed her eyes and wondered what day it was. She had been in a deep, deep sleep, dreaming about swimming in a vast pool of chocolate ice cream.

3131,6263,"When he first began, the best thing about my dad working as an astronaut for NASA seemed to be that he would leave me alone. We had always clashed: he called me a ""smart aleck,"" and all he appeared to care about was whether or not I did my science and math homework. I could be out late, going to parties, and getting into trouble, and he wouldn't even bat an eye so long as I finished my chemistry homework. Meanwhile, I was terrible at both math and science; my best grades were in English.",1.0
3232,6465,"A beam of light shone from across the tennis court. It moved forward, hitting the path in front of the art house, but leaving the slope beneath the porch dark. Greta smiled. Not only had they not gotten caught, but Meredith knew her name. Once the light was out of sight, it was a mad dash across the field, the girls weaving around each other in a sort of focused chaos. Greta was a fast sprinter, and she was the first to make it past the climbing wall to the little clearing in the woods.",1.0

3434,6869,"Melanie doesn't like to be in public. It's an effort for her mom to even get her to go to school. Sometimes, on the bad days, she decides she can't handle being in the classroom for six whole hours. On the bad days, her mom lets her stay in bed as long as she reads something useful.

Coming from verdant Palo Alto, where every lawn was green and manicured, these dry Texas hills were a change. She switched her focus back to the computer in front of her, skimming through her presentation one more time as if she didn't know all of the PowerPoint slides by heart already, after three weeks of practice.
